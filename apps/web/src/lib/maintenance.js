// The Login page asks GET /api/auth/maintenance at runtime and follows the
// server's answer (toggled by the LOGIN_MAINTENANCE env var on the API —
// '1' on, '0' off — no rebuild needed). This static object is only used
// (a) as the initial render state before the probe answers, and (b) when the
// API is unreachable — in which case showing the banner is honest, since
// sign-in couldn't succeed anyway. The server twin lives in
// services/api/src/routes/auth.js.
