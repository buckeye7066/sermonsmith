// Login maintenance mode — FALLBACK copy + default.
//
// The Login page asks GET /api/auth/maintenance at runtime and follows the
// server's answer (toggled by the LOGIN_MAINTENANCE env var on the API —
// '1' on, '0' off, default OFF — no rebuild needed). This static object is
// only the initial render state before the probe answers and the fallback
// when the API is unreachable; `active: false` matches the API's default so
// a normal page load never flashes the upgrade banner. The server twin lives
// in services/api/src/routes/auth.js.
